# IBIO-6000

The intent of this code to take the available data from DS-ITLP.txt which contains a list of insect Lepidoptera specimens captured in various US ports.

This code is intended to support analysis of the DNA Barcoding data using R and R Studio from a paper titled "Using DNA barcoding to improve invasive pest identification at U.S. ports-of-entry" from 2019, available here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6748562/

# Data analysis
1 - Determine approximate # of identified specimens by family, sub-family, genus, and species

2 - Determine approximate # of un-identified specimens

3 - Determine representation of specimens per country of origin

4 - Determine representation of specimens captured in US states
